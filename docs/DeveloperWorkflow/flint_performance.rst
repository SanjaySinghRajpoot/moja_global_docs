FLINT Performance

FLINT uses scientific modulesmodels to estimate fluxes of GHGs between pools. 
There are several models available for each type of GHG flux e.g. Tier 1 
formulas or emission factors and more sophisticated Tier 3 models for forest 
growth or soil carbon dynamics. The user can start with a simple model 
for all land uses and can then switch to more accurate models for the most 
important land cover types when better data becomes available. More importantly,
these models allow FLINT to make projections of GHG fluxes. The model only needs
to receive the activity data to run its calculations formulae whether those
describe that is in the past or in the future.

FLINT is using the same models for making projections as for monitoring 
implementation progress. This ensures that the approach used for planning 
is the same as the one used for reporting, so the results are consistent and
time series are seamless at the transition from reporting to projections.
In many other cases the tool used for planning is different from the tool used
for reporting and it is hard to identify whether the discrepancy between the
two is due to implementation or to measurement errors.

FLINT can apply accurate models for project areas that have extensive data, while
it can apply less demanding models for the rest of the countries. This ensures 
that achievements reached by projects are not lost when they are included into national 
accounts. Most countries are currently using systems that are not spatially explicit 
like FLINT. In these systems, land cover types are aggregated and the specific achievements 
of a project area are reduced to the average emission applied to that land cover type or 
they cannot be identified at all within the national accounts.
